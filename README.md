Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They needed a game made called Draw It or Lose It on mulitple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job of explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each OS.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I like that I had the tools already needed to help me prepare for each OS

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think my requirements section could've been more descriptive

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what the user said and thought about what that would mean in technical terms such as tools needed. It's important because 90% of times, the user make the product. Meaning, no users, product goes poof because no money. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I took what the user needed and converted it into a tangible program.
